# Author Atrrbution (AA) and Books Recommender System (BRS)
Have deploied a distrbuted deep learning (DDL) model on Google TPUs backend instead of a GPU for Author Atrbution using Arabert transformer. This decrease the taining time from days to few hours. Please refere to the slides in the project repo.

# PART#1, Author Atrrbution (AA)

### Project Motivation  
The Arabic langauge is a big challenge in the NLP domian because of its huge vocabulary and versatility, in addition it does not get enough attention making it a difficult challenge to overcome. Therefore King Fahad library is looking for a way to help visitors find Arabic authors based on the authorâ€™s writing style and recommend books with similar writing style to get more people into reading by helping them finding books from a certain writing style.  

### File Descriptions  
Proposal- Folder containing the project's proposal  
MVP- Folder containing the project's Minimum vaiable product  
Code_Slides_writeup- Folder containing the project's notebook (in code folder), PowerPoint presentation (in slides folder), and a summery (in writeup folder)

### How To Interact With Your Project  
Open the notebook in jupyter notebook to view the code and technical details, or read the slides for a quick view about our findings, or visit the project's [website](https://share.streamlit.io/a-safarji/books-recommnder-/main/basedon_user.py).  

### Results Summery  
AraBert performed amazingly will dispaite some documents being very short and some authores having 2-3 huge books.

# PART#2, Books Recommender System (BRS)  
On the top of AA, we create a recommnder system to tell what books are similar from the transformer output or user input.
