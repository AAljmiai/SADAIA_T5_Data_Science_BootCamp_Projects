## Problem Description

The owner of the house or villa intends to offer it for sale. But he does not know how much he offers, and he is afraid to offer it at a low price once, and a large percentage goes to him, or he offers it at a high price once, and no one buys it. One of the solutions available is to go to the real estate sites and ask for a price, but this valuation service is expensive and asks for a percentage, we can reach 10% of the selling price.


## Solution:
A startup company in the field of data science called Itqan Cube consisting of Ahmed, Afrah, Abdullah and Omar

Embracing the problem and thinking about creating a website or program that makes a prediction of the average price of a house or villa using linear regression
