## Problem Statement
You can not read the daily news without encountering an article about Crypto Currency. Most people are intrigued to invest, but they don’t acquire the proper financial knowledge to make decisions by themselves, they most likely require the help of domain experts. Hence, we’re developing a search engine to analyze the sentiment of crypto currency from Reddit, that enables the interested traders to search for the Crypto Currency of their choice and get an understanding of where the currency is going at the moment.

## Questions:
● Is it possible to give investors an idea about each currency?
● Can we do sentiment analysis on reddit posts to foresee the future of its value in
the market?
